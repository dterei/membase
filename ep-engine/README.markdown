# The membase engine

This is the membase engine.  Initially, somewhat jokingly, it was
called the "eventually persistent" engine.  The name stuck, we think
mostly because it's easy to say.

## Building

You will need a storage-engine capable memcached and its included
headers.

The easiest way to do this if you don't want to install memcached from
source would be to just create a source tree and reference it.

### Building Memcached

For example, assume you keep all of your projects in `~/prog/`, you
can do this:

    cd ~/prog
    git clone -b engine git://github.com/membase/memcached.git
    cd memcached
    git checkout engine
    ./config/autorun.sh
    ./configure
    make

### Building the Eventually Persistent Engine

    cd ~/prog
    git clone git@github.com:membase/ep-engine.git
    cd ep-engine
    ./config/autorun.sh
    ./configure --with-memcached=$HOME/prog/memcached
    make

## Running

An example invocation using the ep engine from your dev tree and
keeping the database in `/tmp/ep.db` looks like this:

    ~/prog/memcached/memcached -v -E ~/prog/ep-engine/.libs/ep.so \
        -e dbname=/tmp/ep.db
