* Hacking Moxi

* Prerequisites

 - autoconf
 - automake
 - autotools
 - libevent
 - check

* Getting Started

After checking out a git repository, you must first run autogen.sh
once in order to create the configure script.

Next, run the configure script and start doing builds.

* Setting up Git

Though not required, there are a couple of things you can add to git
to help development.

** Pre Commit Hook

The pre-commit hook can be used to ensure that your tree passes tests
before allowing a commit.  To do so, add the following to
.git/hooks/pre-commit (which must be executable):

    #!/bin/sh
    make test

** Post Commit Hook

Because the version number changes on each commit, it's good to use a
post commit hook to update the version number after each commit so as
to keep the reporting accurate.  To do so, add the following to
.git/hooks/post-commit (which must be executable)

    #!/bin/sh
    ./version.sh

* Running tests

It has been noted that tests hang on some OSs.  After investigation, 
this is due to those OSs using a default shell which doesn't kill off
the child process from a kill.  This has been noted on Ubuntu with 
the shell dash.  To run tests convert the default shell to bash with 
dpkg-reconfigure.
